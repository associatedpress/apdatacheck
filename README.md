# AP Data Check

## Overview

This library implements some common data checking practices in R. Currently, the following tasks are our focus:

* Import

* Basic checks on due diligence

* Basic analytical steps

* Data loss or duplication from joins

* Geographical data

The checklist for data is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qQ1uB8TSoeJym06dXGg1-rMU7RD6xTdFIiKMvBG9C_w/edit)

## Getting Started

Currently, the library only provides some functions defined in individual scripts for the task.

Import functions take in a filename and a data frame.

At present, all functions report results in the console.
