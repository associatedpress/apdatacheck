What "groups" will we want to wrap functions in?

How will user be able to run a given group?

What easy pass/fail check can we give for each function?

Settle on what verbose/non verbose means when it comes to warning messages

Do we want to use a testing framework?

What "rules" for writing a module should apply to contributors?

Are there common signatures we should apply to all modules created?

How can people contribute? Pull request? Is there a modular way to contribute?

How should we deal with column detection?

Are we okay with proliferating data files?

Should we look into creating mocks for some of these data files?
