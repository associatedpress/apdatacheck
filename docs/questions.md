5. Settle on what verbose/non verbose means when it comes to warning messages

6. Do we want to use a testing framework?

7. What "rules" for writing a module should apply to contributors?

8. Are there common signatures we should apply to all modules created?

9. How can people contribute? Pull request? Is there a modular way to contribute?

10. How should we deal with column detection?

11. Are we okay with proliferating data files?
